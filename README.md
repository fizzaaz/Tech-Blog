## Description

üîçDevelopers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. I have build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers‚Äô posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
